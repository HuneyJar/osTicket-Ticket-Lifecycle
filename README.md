- Email: karen@osticket.com</br>
- Full name: <b>Karen Karen</b></br>
- Help Topic: <b>Business Critical Outage</b></br>

- Message: <b>Customers are reporting that they are getting 404 error when browsing to online banking.</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Assignment:</b>
  

- She assigned the Priority level to Emergency, for the ticket seems to be a business impacting incident. 
- She assigns the responsibility of the ticket to herself. 
- She, therefore, assigns the SLA Plan to SEV-A (must respond within 1 hour in 24/7 schedule). 

</p>
<p>
<b>Working the Issue:</b></br>

</p>

<p>
<b>Resolution:</b>

- Email: ken@osticket.com</br>

- Help Topic: <b>Personal Computer Issues</b></br>
- Issue Summary: <b>Entire Account Dept Adobe Reader Not Working</b></br>
- Message: <b>Ever since the upgrade last night, nobody in accounting has been able to use adobe reader.</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Assignment:</b>
  
- Jane assigns the priority to High, since the Adobe Reader being down for the entire department might impact business.
- She assigns the ticket to John Doe.

</p>

<p>

<p>
